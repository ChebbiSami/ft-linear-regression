The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.
For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car
by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm

## usage

You need python3.
```

```

```
> python3 train.py dataset.csv
```

```
> python3 estimate.py
```
