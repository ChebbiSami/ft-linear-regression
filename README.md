# ft_linear_regression

The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.
For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car
by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm

## usage

You need python3.

You can create a virtual python env using `setup_env.sh`
```
> ./setup_env.sh 

> source ./virtual_env/bin/activate
```

or simply install the requirements:
```
> pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

```
> python3 train.py
```

```
> python3 estimate.py
```

```
> python3 accurracy.py
```
